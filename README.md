# Jay Arun's portfolio

This is my professional portfolio project created on Feb 23 to showcase my skills. It uses AWS and ReactJS

## Technologies Used

1.Git and github
2. SSH
  --> Had difficulties to configure git user name and password since initially ssh-add was not working in my local to add the private key. If when added, I dont have to everytime feed the username & password while checking in the code. Finally I figured out.. yay!!. I came out of portfolio project and navigated to ssh path. Initiated, ssh-agent via eval variant and then tried to add key. It worked. It took may be 20 mins to trouble shoot the issue by going over stack overflow forums.
